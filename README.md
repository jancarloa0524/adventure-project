# Adventure Project

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the **skills** we have learned, which include:
* Use of terminal commands.
* Use of Git commands.
* Writing MD files. 
* Collaborating with other users over Github.  

You can start with either the [MD](https://github.com/jancarloa0524/adventure-project/blob/main/home.md) early first version of our project, 
or you can start with the [final project](https://jancarloa0524.github.io/adventure-project/) made with HTML and CSS.

Here is the [Google Drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/178l6lW6LR1INJTjErF8VUu4Jom-GilCVfyXFVIb9s6c/edit) ([img link for those who can't access gDrawing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3VkNAH7DATgFL2h08UIFuTJce3Qk9Zd/view?usp=sharing)) which demonstrates our thought process and ideas.
